## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

The Atbash Cipher program is a project that I embarked upon to deepen my understanding of Python. As a relatively new learner, having started exploring Python just a few weeks ago, I dedicated approximately 6 hours to build this application. With a user-friendly GUI at its core, the program allows users to enter a message and effortlessly encode it using the Atbash Cipher algorithm. Furthermore, users have the convenience of decoding an encoded message or directly inputting an already encoded message to reveal its deciphered version. This project not only showcases my progress in Python but also serves as a valuable learning experience in applying the Atbash Cipher algorithm in a practical manner.
